Workbenches:
In RHOAI, a workbench is a containerized, cloud-native working environment for data scientists. Workbenches run as OpenShift pods 
and are designed for machine learning and data science. To this end, workbenches include the JupyterLab notebook execution environment, 
standard data science libraries, such as TensorFlow, and GPU acceleration capabilities, among other features. RHOAI ships with preconfigured 
workbench images, which provide data scientists with stable working environments with little setup. The implementation of workbenches 
relies on the Kubeflow upstream project.

Workbench images:
A workbench image is a container image that RHOAI uses to create workbenches. RHOAI includes a number of images ready to use for multiple 
common data science stacks. Each image contains a different set of libraries and versions. Minimal Python, Standard Data Science, PyTorch, 
and TensorFlow are examples of default images included in RHOAI.

Cluster storage
Workbenches run as containers, and containers are designed to be stateless. However, users must be able to retain their work after 
logging out or if the workbench restarts. To make workbenches stateful, RHOAI uses cluster storage, which is a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) 
mounted in a specific directory of the workbench container. Every workbench includes, at least, one cluster storage mounted in the root 
directory of the workbench.

Data Connections:
In RHOAI, a data connection is a set of configuration parameters for connecting workbenches to S3-compatible storage services. When you 
associate a data connection to a workbench, RHOAI injects the values of the data connection as environment variables into the workbench.
