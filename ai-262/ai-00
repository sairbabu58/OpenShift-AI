Data Science: (DS)

Data science challenges range from capturing and gathering data, to querying, describing, analyzing and visualizing the data to extract 
knowledge and answer questions. Being such a diverse field, data science integrates techniques from many other areas, such as algebra, 
calculus, statistics, probability, data and software engineering, and Big Data.

Machine Learning: (ML)

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of data science that aims to train computers to learn patterns from data and produce generalized responses.
These trained, intelligent systems are called ML models, or models. In general terms, an ML model is a mathematical function that takes a 
set of inputs and produces an output. When you train a model, you are in fact applying an algorithm that learns the operations that this 
function must compute to produce the desired output. The function learns these operations by using the patterns discovered in the training 
data set.

Generalization is one of the most important features of ML models, and refers to the ability of a model to produce satisfactory responses 
on unseen data. For example, assume that you train a model to recognize cats by using a training data set of 1000 images. You can consider
that the model generalizes well if it detects cats that were not initially included in the initial 1000 training images.

The ML techniques are diverse and suitable for different purposes.

- Traditional ML techniques provide best results in structured data, such as tabular data sets. These methods are suitable for predicting 
  numerical values, categorizing, or segmenting data automatically. For example, you can apply these techniques to predict house pricing.
- Deep learning techniques are powerful and provide best results in artificial cognition and generation, typically by using unstructured 
  data such as text, audio, and images.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) is arguably more specialized, and not always considered a DS technique. Rather than using existing data for 
  training, RL simulates actions and outcomes for learning. A notable example of the use of Reinforcement Learning is training models 
  to play video games or classic strategy games, such as Chess and Go.
