Red Hat OpenShift AI Installation:

Red Hat OpenShift AI Deployment Options:

You can install Open Data Hub, which is the upstream project of Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI), on any OpenShift deployment option. 
Red Hat offers a enterprise-grade supported Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) service, based on Open Data Hub, in two different deployment options.
- As a self-managed service running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP).
- As a managed cloud service running on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

If you use the RHOAI managed cloud service, then you do not need to perform the RHOAI components installation. This course focuses on the 
RHOAI self-managed platform. To learn more about the RHOAI cloud service, see the Red Hat OpenShift AI Service Definition article in 
the references section.


Red Hat OpenShift AI Installation Operators:

- NVIDIA GPU operators 
- Node Feature Discovery operators
- Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines operator
- Red Hat OpenShift Serverless 
- OpenShift Service Mesh operators
- RHOAI operator (Install this operator after installed all the above operator. 
                   or if you installed 1st then dont create DSC before installed all above operators)


RHOAI Requirements:
- A product subscription to RHOAI Self-Managed.
- Access to a RHOCP cluster in version 4.12 or later, with cluster-admin privileges.
- Two worker nodes with at least 8 CPUs and 32 GiB of RAM available for the RHOAI operator.
- A default storage class with at least ReadWriteOnce (RWO) mode. RHOAI uses the OpenShift default storage class for dynamically 
  provisioning persistent volumes for resources such as workbenches.
- An identity provider. RHOAI uses the same identity provider as the OpenShift cluster.
- All the operators that your installation needs. As explained previously, if you plan to use some RHOAI features, then you must 
  install the operators before installing the RHOAI operator.
