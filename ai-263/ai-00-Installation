Red Hat OpenShift AI Installation:

Red Hat OpenShift AI Deployment Options:

You can install Open Data Hub, which is the upstream project of Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI), on any OpenShift deployment option. 
Red Hat offers a enterprise-grade supported Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) service, based on Open Data Hub, in two different deployment options.
- As a self-managed service running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP).
- As a managed cloud service running on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

If you use the RHOAI managed cloud service, then you do not need to perform the RHOAI components installation. This course focuses on the 
RHOAI self-managed platform. To learn more about the RHOAI cloud service, see the Red Hat OpenShift AI Service Definition article in 
the references section.
