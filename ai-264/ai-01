Machine Learning with Other Languages

- R
R is a language historically used in scientific research for statistical analysis, including machine learning. Popular R packages 
for ML include Caret, TensorFlow for R, XGBoost, and Glmnet, among others.

- Julia
Julia is a relatively recent language. Created in 2012, it quickly gained traction in academia and research environments. 
In these environments, Julia ML in data science is common and utilizes libraries such as MLJ.jl, Knet.jl and TensorFlow.js.

- Java
Traditionally, Java has been a common option for machine learning, especially before the popularization of Python. Noteworthy examples 
of Java ML applications and libraries include Weka or OpenNLP.

- JavaScript
Although JavaScript has been historically used for web development, the popularity of Node.js has made JavaScript ubiquitous. The myriad 
of JavaScript applications also includes machine learning. Libraries such as BrainJS and TensorFlowJS can train and run models directly 
in a web browser.

- MATLAB
MATLAB is a classic tool for numerical computation in engineering and science. Rather than just a programming language, 
MATLAB is a full-fledged platform that includes its own syntax and IDE. MATLAB is a proprietary solution, but you can find open 
source alternatives such as GNU Octave.

Note: 
If you wish to create machine learning models in RHOAI by using languages other than Python, then you must create a custom workbench. 
Such a workbench should include a Kernel that can execute code in your language of choice. For example, to create a workbench for the 
Julia language, you could create a workbench image that includes the IJulia kernel. With this image, you could create notebooks that 
can run Julia code.
